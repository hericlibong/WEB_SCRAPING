Cris Tovani,  Why Do I Have to Read This?: Literacy Strategies to Engage Our Most Reluctant Students ,  paperback Edition , 39.33 , 26.49 ,51 ,"Cris loves studying the “knowing-doing” gap by investigating how to implement best practice research with 125+ students. Throughout her career, she has tried to take reading and writing research and apply it to all kinds of learning situations. She believes it is important to share with colleagues her successes as well as her failures to highlight how incredibly complex teaching is. ,  , For the past 34 years, Cris has taught grades one through twelve. In addition to being a classroom teacher, she’s had the privileged of working with preservice and secondary teachers. She served several years as an adjust professor at the University of Colorado at Denver and the Denver University. ,  , Cris provides workshops on disciplinary literacy as well as assessment for learning. Her focus is modeling how to integrate literacy strategies into lessons so students can be better readers and writers of disciplinary text. Her favorite days are the ones when she gets to plan with teachers and then work in classrooms with students. Cris strives to “walk the talk” as she models for teachers how to plan for engagement and execute instruction so that students get to read, write, and discuss for more minutes of the class period than their teacher talks. ,  , Cris’s new book is titled, ,Why Do I Have to Read This?  Literacy Strategies to Engage Our Most Reluctant Students,. Other books she has written are:, I Read it but I Don’t Get It,, ,Do I Really Have,to Teach Reading,? ,So, What do They Really Know?, And ,No More Telling as Teaching: Less Lecture, More Engaged Learning,.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png

Bora Chung,  Cursed Bunny: Stories ,"   December 6, 2022 ", 13.99 ," 14.99 , 31.57 ",459 ,"“If you were the kind of child who was enthralled by ,Scary Stories to Read in the Dark,, Bora Chung writes for you. Like the work of Carmen Maria Machado and Aoko Matsuda, Chung’s stories are so wonderfully, blisteringly strange and powerful that it's almost impossible to put ,Cursed Bunny, down. In short, this collection may, in fact, be a cursed object in the best possible way.” ―,Kelly Link, bestselling author of Get In Trouble,""Bora Chung's ,Cursed Bunny ,mines those places where what we fear is true and what is true meet and separate and re-meet. The resulting stories are indelible. Haunting, funny, gross, terrifying—and yet when we reach the end, we just want more.""―,Alexander Chee, author of How to Write an Autobiographical Novel,""Anton Hur’s nimble translation manages to capture the tricky magic of Chung’s voice — its wry humor and overarching coolness broken by sudden, thrilling dips into passages of vivid description. Even as Chung presents a catalog of grotesqueries that range from unsettling to seared-into-the-brain disturbing, her power is in restraint. She and Hur always keep the reader at a slight distance in order for the more chilling twists to land with maximum impact, allowing us to walk ourselves into the trap.”,  ―,Violet Kupersmith, The New York Times Book Review,“Sharp, wildly inventive, and slightly demented (in the most enjoyable way, of course)… All we can say is buckle in, because when these stories take their horrific turn there’s no setting them down.”―,Chicago Review of Books,“Whether borrowing from fable, folktale, speculative fiction, science fiction, or horror, Chung’s stories corkscrew toward devastating conclusions—bleak, yes, but also wise and honest about the nightmares of contemporary life. Don't read this book while eating—but don’t skip these unflinching, intelligent stories, either.”―,Kirkus Reviews (starred review),“Nothing concentrates the mind like Chung’s terrors, which will shrivel you to a bouillon cube of your most primal instincts.”―,Rhoda Feng, Vulture,""[Chung's] glorious anglophone debut, enabled by award-winning Anton Hur, is poised to shock and delight. Bizarrely enigmatic, Chung’s collection proves irresistible.""―,Terry Hong, Booklist (starred review),“This short story collection is like a car crash you can't look away from: grotesque in the best way…Each story is fantastically unique, and unlike anything I've ever read before.”―,Kirby Beaton, Buzzfeed’s Best December Books of 2022,“Bora Chung Soars with a provocative collection of stories. ...remarkable... The 10 stories are beyond imagination: breathtaking, wild, crazy, the most original fiction I have ever encountered. …each more astounding than the last.”―,Louisa Ermelino, Publishers Weekly,“Like a family in a home, fantastic stories gather together in this book. The stories not only take their revenge, but also love you, and comfort you. You'll end up completely endeared to this fascinating collection!”―,Kyung-sook Shin, New York Times Bestselling author of Please Look After Mom and Violets,""Cool, brilliantly demented K-horror—just the way I like it!"" ―,Ed Park, author of Personal Days,“This Korean debut collection is a stunner. The stories included are absurdly unique, delightfully monstrous, horrifically insightful and chillingly satisfying.”,―,―Ms. Magazine,“A collection of exquisitely crafted, spooky and unnerving tales that haunted me long after reading. Each story is a macabre gem, shot through with visceral horror, wry humor, and subtly profound insights on human nature. These stories convey how the traumas and transgressions of the past, individual and collective, and erupt into the present, distorting and eroding our perception of reality. Bora Chung is an amazingly inventive and daring writer. I will revisit these stories whenever I need a reminder of how fresh and vital prose can be.”―,Kate Folk, author of Out There,""What made this book truly transcendental was the sense of absolute dread that many of its stories summoned. Chung’s work fits neatly beside that of Brian Evenson and Kelly Link—cerebral fiction that might give you nightmares.""―,Tobias Carroll, Words Without Borders,“If you want a spooky set of stories that will crawl under your skin and burrow into your marrow and stay there forever, Chung’s collection is a freaky, unforgettable outing. There’s a folkloric quality to this collection, like these are urban legends that have finally been put to paper.”―,Wired Magazine,“Disturbing, chilling, wrenching, and absolute genius. I wanted Chung to write a story about a reader getting a deep look inside her fantastic swirling mind. I had to take breaks and gulps of air before plunging back into each story. Magnetic, eerie, immensely important.” ―,Frances Cha, author of If I Had Your Face,“Fables of frightening moral clarity told in calm, bell-like prose, ,Cursed Bunny, aims to unsettle. It's as assured and brilliant as a nightmare. With an unflinching gaze and a sly humor, Chung has built a world both unfamiliar and eerily familiar, whose truths echo into our own. The indelible work of a master.”―,Shruti Swamy, author of The Archer and A House is a Body,“[A] get-under-your-skin collection”―,LitHub,“The strange and everyday are melded in these startling and original tales… ,Cursed Bunny, is [Chung’s] first book to be translated into English, and hopefully not the last.”―,Connie Biewald, San Francisco Chronicle,“While the stories in ,Cursed Bunny, by Bora Chung blend elements of horror, fantasy and the surreal, each is viscerally rooted in the real fears and pressures of everyday life.”―,International Booker Prize judges,“Chung debuts with a well-crafted and horrifying collection of dark fairy tales, stark revenge fables, and disturbing body horror. Clever plot twists and sparkling prose abound. Chung’s work is captivating and terrifying.”―,―Publishers Weekly,“Chung’s genre-defying collection breathes life into literary horror as the stories incorporate common fears and societal flaws with elements of the fantastic in the most chilling ways. The tales in Cursed Bunny will draw readers in with familiar themes and genre tropes and leave them pleasantly surprised, if not disturbed by the monsters within.”―,The West Trade Review,“A unique and chilling collection”―,We Are Bookish,“Bora Chung's stories succeed at being deeply visceral experiences that do what the best fairy tales do: convey the unspeakable in a way that is nevertheless collectively understood…perfect for fans of Bong Joon-ho's films or Helen Oyeyemi's fiction.”,―,Alice Martin, Shelf Awareness,“Addictively bizarre … bone-chilling”―,BookReporter,Bora Chung, has written three novels and three collections of short stories.

The book presents a new vision about assessment in the 21st century, which is influenced by new standards, accountability and technological advances in education. The new concept of Assessment as, for, and of Learning that Gottlieb presents will transform education and provide a different perspective of assessment to all stakeholders.

This is critical in two ways: first, the book is lively and interesting--serving as a welcome, well-designed text for teacher preparation courses, and second, the scenarios with their companion reflection questions can serve as an excellent stand-alone reference and thought-provoking resource for the increasing number of classroom teachers who find themselves responsible for the instruction and assessment of students acquiring English alongside their content area learning."", -- Alison L.

In the current version of the Reading Wars, it is difficult for any of us to say we were wrong about some of our beliefs or practices. And thus, few do.

Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra,  Don Quixote (Penguin Classics) ,"   February 25, 2003 ", 13.99 , 0.49 ,"2,339 ","""The highest creation of genius has been achieved by Shakespeare and Cervantes, almost alone."" —,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra, was born in Spain in 1547 to a family once proud and influential but now fallen on hard times. His father, a poor barber-surgeon, wandered up and down Spain in search of work. Educated as a child by the Jesuits in Seville, the creator of ,Don Quixote, grew up to follow the career of a professional soldier. He was wounded at Lepanto in 1571, captured by the Turks in 1575, imprisoned for five years, and was finally rescued by the Trinitarian friars in 1580. On his return to Spain he found his family more impoverished than ever before. Supporting his mother, two sisters, and an illegitimate daughter, he settled down to a literary career and had hopes of becoming a successful playwright, but just then the youthful ,Lope de Vega, entered triumphantly to transform the Spanish theatre by his genius. ,Galatea,, a pastoral romance, was published in 1585, the year of Cervantes’ marriage to ,Catalina de Palacios y Salazar Vozmediano,. But it did not bring him an escape from poverty, and he was forced to become a roving commissary for the Spanish armada. This venture, which led to bankruptcy and jail, lasted for fifteen years. Although he never knew prosperity, Cervantes did gain a measure of fame during his lifetime, and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza were known all over the world. Part I of Don Quixote was published in 1605; in 1613, his ,Exemplary Novels, appeared, and these picaresque tales of romantic adventure gained immediate popularity. ,Journey to Parnassas,, a satirical review of his fellow Spanish poets, appeared in 1614, and Part II of Don Quixote in 1615 as well as ,Eight Plays and Eight Interludes,.

This would appeal to anyone who enjoys personal accounts of everyday experiences, especially those colored by a distinctive cultural and historical setting, as they are in this book. It could make for good beach reading."" - Official Review of Online Book Club,""In equal parts humorous and poignant, The Elephant Tooth of '95 by Rana Baydoun is a wonderful novel whose original plot is buoyed by delightful cultural details. It is a story that inspires strength and hope even during hardship."" ,-  Edith Wairimu for Readers' Favorite.,""An inspiring book for young women to find their way and that taking a chance is a good thing to do to grow as a person. The book took me to another world, and I could not stop reading. It is a story about growing up and overcoming challenges in finding a job, finding love, and your place in society."" -  J M 10 for Online Book Club,""Balances the painful scenes in the story with the livelier sections of Noor's story who always finds the positive and comical in otherwise bad situations. It gives those who have never been in a situation like herself some insight into what life is like in times like hers. Lots of people would relate to this book and could provide them comfort or understanding. It is also a very inspirational book showing how one can strive in such an environment."" - Dagni Botes for Online Book Club,""Through a lens of cheerful naivety, Noor narrates her experiences of starting her career, love, and her quest to find her place in the world.

These vignettes string together a loose plot of a young woman trying to navigate a modernizing world, while still holding on to traditional values. Noor narrates her story with self-deprecating humor that often highlights social differences between her conservative upbringing and the different cultures emerging in Lebanon in the nineties. I would recommend this romance novel as a light summer read."" - Emily Smith for Online Book Club,Rana Baydoun, was born in the buzzing city of Beirut and brought up in a typical Lebanese family amid lots of love and drama.

Even though she lived in amazing cities such as Hamburg, Athens, and Lausanne, Rana always had a strong feeling of nostalgia for her hometown of Beirut. She felt that there was so much more to tell than just the usual cliché news of bombs and power cuts.In her first novel, The Elephant Tooth of 1995 she takes her readers on a compelling rollercoaster journey portraying a typical Lebanese life through the eyes of a young girl called Noor.Rana lives with her husband and three kids and their on & off cat in Dubai.www.ranabaydoun.com",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png

Salman Rushdie,  Victory City: A Novel ,"  Hardcover – February 7, 2023 ", 24.99 , 13.99 ,,"“[An] awe-inspiring saga that looks at what it’s really like to be the center of the universe.”,—,Time, (one of the most anticipated books of 2023),“It’s splendid that Salman Rushdie has a new novel out. . . . Better still, it’s a cracker. Purportedly a rediscovered ancient epic, it’s about the transformative power of human creativity, the enduring ability of art to shape the world.”,—,The Guardian, (fiction to look out for in 2023),“Rushdie has already proven himself of his generation’s most adept literary stars, and his forthcoming epic fantasy novel promises to be one of the best releases of the year.”,—,The Week, (one of the must-read books in early 2023),“Salman Rushdie has created a radiant myth about mythmaking. ,Victory City, is a book that privileges the ethical imagination and the unmistakable permanence of storytelling. Within these pages, you will find global travelers, rapacious kings, cave dwellers, prophets of doom, and, at its fierce and eloquent heart, a storyteller who reminds us that death may take away a lot of things, but never the power of our words. Beyond war, beyond violence, even beyond life itself, the story, and the storyteller, last.”,—Colum McCann,“,Victory City, is vast and deep, soaring and scintillating. Every page is magical, every page is gorgeous. In the way of a significant work of art, it does not resemble any other novel I could name . . . A major accomplishment by one of our greatest living writers.”,—Michael Cunningham,“Salman Rushdie is a genius and I wish he could read me a story—or a chapter of his book—every night before bed. The scale and scope of his intellect and his imagination is googolplex, as big as infinity and then some. In ,Victory City,, he spins an epic tale that brings us back to the key questions of what it is to be human, to be authentic, to love and to grieve.”,—A. M. Homes,“No one, and I mean no one, can bring an entire world to life with the authority, wisdom, humor, and panache of Salman Rushdie. In the pantheon of his novels, ,Victory City, stands out as book of particular imaginative achievement. It defies category, but it invites pleasure.”,—Gary Shteyngart,“,Victory City, is a capacious and sweeping telling in which writing about the past is a way of also staring dead on at the present and historicizing human nature. In the wit and poetry of his prose, Rushdie shows us not only the world we’ve made, but—more importantly—the one we can remake.”,—Natasha Trethewey,“This is Salman Rushdie at his most virtuosic, a wondrous tale of medieval India which is also, as ever, a fable about the triumph of life—in all its joyous, messy excess—over the forces of fanaticism and darkness.”,—Hari Kunzru,Salman Rushdie, is the author of fourteen previous novels, including ,Midnight’s Children, (for which he won the Booker Prize and the Best of the Booker), ,Shame, The Satanic Verses, The Moor’s Last Sigh,, and ,Quichotte,, all of which have been shortlisted for the Booker Prize; a collection of stories, ,East, West;, a memoir, ,Joseph Anton;, a work of reportage, ,The Jaguar Smile;, and three collections of essays, most recently ,Languages of Truth,. His many awards include the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel, which he won twice; the PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award; the National Arts Award; the French Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger; the European Union’s Aristeion Prize for Literature; the Budapest Grand Prize for Literature; and the Italian Premio Grinzane Cavour.

Coetzee,, ,The New York Review of Books,Jorges Luis Borges, was born in Buenos Aires in 1899 and educated in Europe. One of the most widely acclaimed writers of our time, he published many collections of poems, essays and short stories, before his death in Geneva in June 1986. In 1961 Borges shared the International Publishers' Prize with Samuel Beckett. The Ingram Merrill Foundation granted him its Annual Literary Award in 1966 for his ""outstanding contribution to literature."" In 1971 Columbia University awarded him the first of many degrees of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa that he was to receive from the English-speaking world. In 1971 he received the fifth biennial Jerusalem Prize and in 1973 was given the Alfonso Reyes Prize, one of Mexico's most prestigious cultural awards. In 1980 he shared the Cervantes Prize (the Spanish world's highest literary accolade) with Gerardo Diego. Borges was Director of the Argentine National Library from 1955 until 1973. In a tribute to Borges, Mario Vargas Llosa wrote: ""His is a world of clear, pure, and at the same time unusual ideas...expressed in words of great directness and restraint.

Jodorowsky was multi-talented from an early age, becoming skilled in puppetry and mime, in addition to writing, by his late teens. He traveled with a pantomime troupe in the 1950s, and within a couple years had made his way to Paris where he collaborated with the world-renowned mime Marcel Marceau. In the 1960s, Jodorowsky ventured further into the world of theater, creating in Mexico, the Panic Movement. This innovative artistic movement allowed him to creatively participate in over a 100 theater productions. The 1970s saw him transition into the world of film where he quickly put a defining stamp on all his cinematic works. He directed several cult films, namely the infamous ""El Topo,"" a Midnight movie favorite. Shortly thereafter, Jodorowsky became attached to direct the adaptation of the famous Frank Herbert sci-fi epic novel ""Dune."" At the preparation stage of the film, he brilliantly assembled a team of extremely diverse and gifted artists such as HR Giger, Chris Foss, Dan O'Bannon, and Moebius, all of who would later be hired as concept artists on Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" The development of ""Dune"" came to a halt due to financial problems, but Jodorowsky, having been exposed to such immense visual talent, propelled himself into writing graphic novels, pairing up with the artist Moebius. This collaboration resulted in what many consider to be one of the most creative European sci-fi graphic novel series of all time, ""The Incal,"" which went on to sell millions of copies worldwide. Since penning ""The Incal,"" Jodorowsky continued writing top selling comic books with a wide variety of Europe's most talented artists, such as ""The White Lama"" (with Bess), ""The Metabarons"" (with Gimenez), ""The Technopriests"" (with Janjetov), and most recently ""Bouncer"" (with Boucq). Along with nurturing his many other talents, Jodorowsky remains a unique storyteller whose published contributions have secured his status as one of the world's most prolific graphic novel writers.,Jerry Frissen (born Thierry Frissen in Belgium) is an American comic book writer and toy & graphic designer. He is the senior graphic designer at Humanoids as well as the author of several best-selling graphic novels, including the anthology comic book series ""Lucha Libre"" (""Unfabulous Five,"" ""The Tikitis""), ""The Zombies That Ate The World"" (""The Z Word"") and the new cycle of the internationally acclaimed series ""The Metabarons,"" co-written with Alejandro Jodorowsky and illustrated by Valentin Sécher, Niko Henrichon and Esad Ribic, under the title ""The Metabaron."" In addition to his work on ""The Metabaron,"" Jerry Frissen is also the author of the forthcoming sci-fi thriller ""Exo"" (March 2018).,Niko Henrichon is a Canadian comic artist most known for “Pride of Baghdad” (Vertigo) and “Noah” (Image), the former earning him an Eisner nomination for Best Penciller/Inker. He has also worked on “Fables”, “New X-Men”, “Sandman” and “Spiderman” in addition to his covers of “Fantasic Four” and “X-Men”.",

Happily, Margo Gottlieb is the exception. In this exciting, practitioner-friendly volume, she shows us how assessment as, for, and of learning can provide a level playing field for today’s language learners. Educators working with English language learners will find this assessment-moxie book truly invaluable."" , -- W. James Popham, Professor Emeritus Published On: 2015-09-28, -- Diane August, Managing Researcher Published On: 2015-11-22, -- Andrea Honigsfeld, Associate Dean and Ed.D. Program Director Published On: 2015-09-28,"",Assessing Language Learners: Bridges to Educational Equity / Connecting Academic Language Proficiency to Student Achievement, 2e, is a great resource for teacher education programs and professional learning opportunities for schools. The book presents a new vision about assessment in the 21st century, which is influenced by new standards, accountability and technological advances in education. The new concept of Assessment as, for, and of Learning that Gottlieb presents will transform education and provide a different perspective of assessment to all stakeholders. This is definitely a book that all educators should read."" , -- Miguel Fernandez, Ph.D., Associate Professor Published On: 2015-07-22, -- Jonathan Gibson, Title III English Learner Program Director Published On: 2016-01-11,"",Framed by a lens of equity, Gottlieb makes the complex landscape of assessment accessible for classroom practitioners of English language learners. Readers will walk away with a crystal clear understanding of the instructional conditions they can create for English language learners, promoting linguistically responsive assessment practices."", -- Trish Morita-Mullaney, Ph.D., ELL Assistant Professor Published On: 2016-01-15,""While we know that first-hand teaching experiences cannot readily be substituted by reading about the work and practice of others, with evocative scenarios of teachers, students and schools used throughout ,Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges to Educational Equity,, Margo Gottlieb comes close to making this happen. This is critical in two ways: first, the book is lively and interesting--serving as a welcome, well-designed text for teacher preparation courses, and second, the scenarios with their companion reflection questions can serve as an excellent stand-alone reference and thought-provoking resource for the increasing number of classroom teachers who find themselves responsible for the instruction and assessment of students acquiring English alongside their content area learning."", -- Alison L. Bailey, Professor of Human Development and Psychology Published On: 2016-01-18,""Assessing English Language Learners, is an important contribution to the field for the many educators who believe that assessment for second language learners is important, but only if it is valid. This book lays out a clear and compelling argument that assessment and equity are not mutually exclusive concepts in educational programs for the nation′s burgeoning population of multilingual learners. Its breadth is impressive and includes important discussions about language proficiency assessment, but also adds ideas for content area assessment practices. Important reading for practitioners and educational leaders,."" -- Kathy Escamilla, Professor Published On: 2016-02-02, -- Valerie Shinas, Associate Professor Published On: 2017-02-22",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png

It is a story that inspires strength and hope even during hardship."" ,-  Edith Wairimu for Readers' Favorite.,""An inspiring book for young women to find their way and that taking a chance is a good thing to do to grow as a person.

It gives those who have never been in a situation like herself some insight into what life is like in times like hers. Lots of people would relate to this book and could provide them comfort or understanding. It is also a very inspirational book showing how one can strive in such an environment."" - Dagni Botes for Online Book Club,""Through a lens of cheerful naivety, Noor narrates her experiences of starting her career, love, and her quest to find her place in the world. Baydoun takes her readers through the streets of Beirut and explores lovely scenes of Lebanese culture. These vignettes string together a loose plot of a young woman trying to navigate a modernizing world, while still holding on to traditional values. Noor narrates her story with self-deprecating humor that often highlights social differences between her conservative upbringing and the different cultures emerging in Lebanon in the nineties. I would recommend this romance novel as a light summer read."" - Emily Smith for Online Book Club,Rana Baydoun, was born in the buzzing city of Beirut and brought up in a typical Lebanese family amid lots of love and drama. Since she was a little girl, Rana loved telling stories to her school teachers, friends, and hundreds of cousins, aunties, and uncles.Her love for storytelling grew stronger with her when she moved abroad. Even though she lived in amazing cities such as Hamburg, Athens, and Lausanne, Rana always had a strong feeling of nostalgia for her hometown of Beirut. She felt that there was so much more to tell than just the usual cliché news of bombs and power cuts.In her first novel, The Elephant Tooth of 1995 she takes her readers on a compelling rollercoaster journey portraying a typical Lebanese life through the eyes of a young girl called Noor.Rana lives with her husband and three kids and their on & off cat in Dubai.www.ranabaydoun.com",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png

One might expect a novel about gun-toting, conspiracy-minded loners to lampoon its key players, but the book succeeds because Cauley appears as curious and empathetic toward the survivalists as she is toward her protagonist . . .

In ,Shifting the Balance,, Burkins and Yates skillfully explore ‘balanced literacy’ and ‘the science of reading’ to find the sweet spots where they overlap, connect, and actually complement one another. The result is a resource that raises our level of instruction while helping children discover and reap the joyful rewards of reading.”, —Susie Rolander, Bank Street College,“What are the research-based, critical elements for teaching reading?

Throughout her career, she has tried to take reading and writing research and apply it to all kinds of learning situations. She believes it is important to share with colleagues her successes as well as her failures to highlight how incredibly complex teaching is. ,  , For the past 34 years, Cris has taught grades one through twelve. In addition to being a classroom teacher, she’s had the privileged of working with preservice and secondary teachers. She served several years as an adjust professor at the University of Colorado at Denver and the Denver University. ,  , Cris provides workshops on disciplinary literacy as well as assessment for learning.

Her favorite days are the ones when she gets to plan with teachers and then work in classrooms with students.

Wildly creative, this novel weaves and dips into class struggle and resentment, dark comedy, bittersweet romance, and the specters of body horror… an absurd, frightening novel that will delight fans of twisty dark fantasies.” ,—Booklist, , “King expands his 2014 short story of the same name with arresting results in this Victorian-esque fantasy that contains moments of both horror and humor… King’s creative worldbuilding is admirable and he makes even walk-on characters feel fully realized.”, ,—,Publishers Weekly, , “Sprawling, densely populated, intricately plotted... with vivid prose, excellent minor characters, and a scrappy, every-which-way inventiveness. Dickens novel meets Hieronymus Bosch painting—dark, chaotic fun.” ,—Kirkus, ,*starred review*, , “A fantastical panorama of twists and turns… King’s latest is a masterpiece of storytelling.” ,—Library Journal, , “An impeccably crafted, wildly imaginative world… at once fantastical and yet grounded in a too-familiar reality of corrosive greed and power grabs. With dark humor and a keen eye for detail, King invites readers into a genre-defying narrative that asks readers to imagine what might be and what could be, as a woman stands between two worlds of her own, asking the same.”,—Shelf Awareness, , "",The Curator, feels a little like Owen King somehow brought a curiosity cabinet to life. There are terrors here, but also marvels and delights, and a set of the most interesting characters I’ve met in some time.

This would appeal to anyone who enjoys personal accounts of everyday experiences, especially those colored by a distinctive cultural and historical setting, as they are in this book. It could make for good beach reading."" - Official Review of Online Book Club,""In equal parts humorous and poignant, The Elephant Tooth of '95 by Rana Baydoun is a wonderful novel whose original plot is buoyed by delightful cultural details. It is a story that inspires strength and hope even during hardship."" ,-  Edith Wairimu for Readers' Favorite.,""An inspiring book for young women to find their way and that taking a chance is a good thing to do to grow as a person. The book took me to another world, and I could not stop reading. It is a story about growing up and overcoming challenges in finding a job, finding love, and your place in society."" -  J M 10 for Online Book Club,""Balances the painful scenes in the story with the livelier sections of Noor's story who always finds the positive and comical in otherwise bad situations. It gives those who have never been in a situation like herself some insight into what life is like in times like hers. Lots of people would relate to this book and could provide them comfort or understanding. It is also a very inspirational book showing how one can strive in such an environment."" - Dagni Botes for Online Book Club,""Through a lens of cheerful naivety, Noor narrates her experiences of starting her career, love, and her quest to find her place in the world. Baydoun takes her readers through the streets of Beirut and explores lovely scenes of Lebanese culture. These vignettes string together a loose plot of a young woman trying to navigate a modernizing world, while still holding on to traditional values. Noor narrates her story with self-deprecating humor that often highlights social differences between her conservative upbringing and the different cultures emerging in Lebanon in the nineties. I would recommend this romance novel as a light summer read."" - Emily Smith for Online Book Club,Rana Baydoun, was born in the buzzing city of Beirut and brought up in a typical Lebanese family amid lots of love and drama.

Peter Watts,  Crysis: Legion ,  Kindle Edition , 13.99 , 17.00 ,101 ,"Biologist, author, and convicted felon, Peter Watts (author of ,Blindsight, and the Rifters trilogy)  appears to be especially popular with people who have never met him. At least, pretty much every award his work has received comes from overseas (with the exception of a recent Hugo, which probably won on a sympathy vote in the wake of recent encounters with the Department of Homeland Security).  His science fiction, oddly enough, has been used as a core text in science and philosophy courses as well as the usual gamut of sf electives;  he only wishes his actual science had been taken half as seriously, back in the day.  Both he and his cat have appeared in the prestigious journal ,Nature,.,--This text refers to an alternate , edition.,1,The thing is, I thought it was all our fault.,It's not that far off from what the Greens have been whining about since the last goddamn century. Global warm--sorry, anthropogenic climate change. Tidal waves, rising sea levels, half the planet's population wandering around looking for a place to crash since their homes got flooded out. There's malaria in the Baltic now, did you know that? A tropical disease. In the fucking Baltic. And somehow South America turned into bloody Siberia when no one was looking, something about melting icepacks short-circuiting the ocean currents. The whole world's fighting over fresh water like a pack of starving dogs with one stripped bone among them, and then Brazil started shooting all those sulfates into the stratosphere and--well, it was turning out just like the environazis said, only way worse and way fucking faster. None of the really nasty stuff was supposed to happen for another forty or fifty years, right?,So we're fucked, and it looks like we fucked ourselves, and all the alarmist whitecoats we shat on before are telling us it's too late now, it's all planetary thermal inertia and unstable breakpoints and big ships turn slowly. There's no way to keep the place from blowing up but maybe we can at least contain the explosion a bit, you know? Try to keep the peace, share whatever's left of the loaves and fishes, keep the worst of the riots from hitting the good ol' US of A. Maintain some kind of order.,That's why I signed up. That's why all of us did. We'd fucked things up by snarfing pork rinds and playing video games while the world turned to shit, and joining the marines was-I don't know. Penance. A chance to make amends.,Except it wasn't us after all, not really, not yet. It was these fuckers from outer space, it was that bloody cryo weapon of theirs, that secret run-in way over in fucking China. We may have primed the avalanche, but Ling Shan was the snowball that started it rolling. And that was just a skirmish, that was so small they even managed to cover it up. A presidential directive or two, a few strategic pulse bombs to fry seismo and satcam, maybe a handful of surgical kills to take care of any Koreans out fishing in the wrong place at the wrong time. All you're left with is a few fuzzy rumors so whacked that not even Fox News would stoop low enough to run with them. Then when the whole world starts listing to starboard a couple of months down the road, you blame it all on greedy shortsighted humans and their damn fossil- fuel economy.,But it was just a skirmish, Roger, and you know what?,So's this.,-N2-2 Alcatraz/Prophet (tentative desig.-awaiting update),,excerpted from Manhattan Incursion Debrief,27/08/2023,Voice-mike intercept, Forensic Debrief, Manhattan Incursion,Subject ID: Unknown (code name Alcatraz),27/08/2023,Laurence Barnes, I think. Prophet.,Alcatraz, then. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Of course I know the stats: I'm dead, not senile. Name, rank, serial number. Doesn't mean shit. That's not who I am anymore.,I'm the guy being debriefed by a low-level functionary because his bosses are too chickenshit to risk being in the same room, that's who. You expect me to think you volunteered for this gig? You think the higher-ups wanted to bring you into the loop, you think they wouldn't be in here themselves if they weren't afraid I might go off the reservation again given half a chance?,You're lying.,No, that's an empirical fact. Your skin conductivity just went up 13 percent. Your eye saccades increased by 24. And you don't want to get into your vocal stress harmonics. You may think you sound pretty solid, but believe me: In the upper registers you're squealing like a little girl.,I can tell stuff like that now. It's not the augments--it's not just the augments. I'm not reading numbers off a tactical overlay or anything, it's more--integrated. I just know this shit. I know a lot of things I'm not supposed to.,But you've got nothing to worry about. Really. If I had any interest in killing you, you'd have been dead before you got through the door. You must realize that.,Doesn't help much, does it?,How do you want to do this?,From the top, then: They put us out to sea the moment the media blackout came down. I mean the moment-- Chino was watching Body-Swap Boxing when the Emergency Broadcast Signal cut in. One minute after that MacroNet starts talking about some kind of massive explosion in New York, and literally three minutes after that we're hauling ass down to the water. There's a Swordfish surfacing off the dock, hasn't even finished blowing its tanks before we're piling inside. Haven't even checked our gear. We are mobilized, man, we're moving just this side of outright panic and we don't even know why. They barely get the hatch closed before we're back underwater.,We strap in. You can hear the screws turning through the hull. The Swordfish is basically a troop carrier with a big drive and a few missile tubes thrown in so it won't feel like such a pussy around the hunter-seekers, but even a Sword has the usual stealth options so you can get in and out without a fuss. They're not engaged. Wherever we're going, apparently we can't even afford a lousy 6 percent cloaking deficit.,Then it's a classic case of hurry up and wait. For eighteen hours. Nobody tells us shit, and the shit they do tell us keeps changing. First we're going to be docking with one of those big inflatable jellyfish down in the mesopelagic, keep us safely off the game board until we're needed. I'm thinking that's okay, at least there's decent headroom in those things, at least they're big enough to let you get away from the-but no, now suddenly we're heading back inshore. And then we're circling off Christ-knows-where for fuck-knows-how-long. Some of the guys try to catch a few winks but the CO handed out the usual stims at the six-hour mark so everyone's boosted on GABA and tricyclics and that supernephrin stuff that makes your joints ache for two fucking weeks post-engagement. I keep a forty of tequila in my kit- you know, strictly for medicinal purposes-and I crack it to take the edge off. Offer it around but nobody else wants any. They say it makes a bad mix with all the neurotropes. Pussies.,Anyway, we're strapped in, we're wired, we're climbing the walls. And suddenly the whine of the screws picks up, the night-lights kick in, and the whole compartment turns bloody red, like one of those Asian necro parlors where they use longwave to make the corpses look prettier. It doesn't take an AI to figure out we're deploying to New York but the CO won't even give up that much. Says we'll get briefed on-site. So we're sitting there in our camo, cheek-to-jowl, and everybody's making up these fairy tales to fill in the gaps. Syntheviral attack, moho nukes tunneling up under Broadway, some kind of coup at CENTCOM. Leavenworth--you know Leavenworth? No, of course you don't--Leavenworth weighs in with his usual crazy-ass theories, says he heard some Venter Biomorphs went all Skynet and turned on their masters, and he won't listen to half the squad pointing out that the Venter labs are way the hell over in California and if we're really heading into the replicant wars don't you think they might, you know, airlift us instead of taking a submarine through the Northwest fucking Passage?,I don't think Leavenworth believed that shit half the time himself. I think he just liked yanking our chains. I'm really going to miss him, if I ever get that part of my brain back.,Every now and then you can hear chatter drifting back through the forward hatch; turns out there's at least six other boats deployed, under orders of some Colonel Barclay I've never heard of. And yeah, big surprise, we're all headed up the East River for Upper Manhattan. Except suddenly we aren't. Suddenly we're detached from the main group and diverting to Battery Park. Secret rendezvous, CO tells us. Maybe a rescue mission. I don't know if he's giving it up or making it up.,So everybody's making these wild-ass guesses and Chino even starts a pool for chrissake, right there in the sub, and I'm sitting there and all I can think about is--,You know I was afraid of water, right?,I mean, of course I didn't tell anybody--I worked through it like you're supposed to, even came in third in the open-water trials last year. It's not a problem. But I almost drowned back when I was eight. Kinda stuck with me. You must have known. There were all these tests. You must have sniffed it out during the psych workup.,Thought so.,So everybody's jammed in there with their theories and Chino's got his pool going, and it's been eighteen hours now and I've been white- knuckling the bench for at least ten of 'em. Parchman figures I'm hungover but all I can think about is: a measly seven centimeters of biosteel between me and the whole Atlantic Ocean and I don't care how strong they say it is, a bunch of threads squeezed out of some gengineered spider's ass is not gonna keep an ocean out forever.,Probably the last time I was right about anything in this whole shitstorm.,Finally some voice comes over the comm, tells us it's time to saddle up. And that's when we hear a ping-not sonar, not our sonar anyway, just a single, solid beat resonating throughout the hull. Everybody falls silent for just a second, and Behrendt looks around and says, ""Anybody hear that?""-,And something kicks us hard in the side.,No alarms, nothing coming over the comm link, just one ping and a giant boom and the whole boat's rolling to port. We don't even have time to scream; there's one microscopic whatthefuck moment and the hull opens up like some giant took a can opener to us. The far side of the compartment just crumples: snaps Behrendt's back like a toothpick, turns her into a rag doll right before my eyes, and then a crossbeam or bracket or some fucking thing tears free of the forward bulkhead and squashes Beaudry like a bug.,We're going down, now--the deck's at some crazy-ass angle, there's water flooding in from the bow, the whole damn hull's groaning like a humpback whale. Now the alarms kick in. Or maybe it's just everybody screaming. There's blood everywhere and you'd think it would blend in with the night-vision redlight but it doesn't, it jumps right out at you, it's solid shiny black. By now the water's not even gushing in, it's rising--like a tide, like a liquid floor sliding up to crush us all against the ceiling. Except the ceiling's a wall, and the rear bulkhead is the roof, and--,And--,Look, you--you know this shit. The sub went down. Period. Why do you need the details? You're not making a fucking documentary.,I know, it's just that--,Fine.,So it's every man for himself. I barely even have a chance to take a breath before the ocean closes over my head and I'm diving down, pushing buddies and body parts out of the way, and I'm fucking scared, man, I can't see anything except bloody backlight and blue sparks as the electronics short out. The sub's still groaning around me, it's crumpling into a paper ball and at least the screams stop underwater but you can hear metal grinding on metal as though it were right inside your fucking head. We get through the forward hatch, it's still black and blue and red everywhere except there's this jagged tear off to the side, this blue-black crevice seething with bubbles. I push through. I look up and there's pale dim light, and I look down and there's this great dark wall of metal sliding past, gashed to shit and bleeding rivers of air. Somewhere down there the bow's already hit bottom because there's a big honking cloud of black mud boiling up from below, engulfing the hull like something live. Like something starving.,And all that matters, in that moment, is that I get to the surface.,There's no Semper-fucking-fi down there in the deeps, let me tell you. Maybe if I'd had my rebreather on. Maybe if I'd had more than one lousy lungful of air to get me thirty meters to the surface. Maybe if I wasn't fighting off flashbacks from fifteen years ago. But no: I don't try to free the trapped or assist the wounded or carry the unconscious to safety on my back. I don't even think about it. There are things in my way: Some are sharp and hard and some are soft and gooshy and I don't fucking care, man, I bull through them all without prejudice or favoritism. I'm an eight-year-old kid again, and I'm dying, and I know what that feels like. Not again. God, not again.,So I'm fighting my way to the surface. Didn't even have the presence of mind to grab a pair of fins, you know, I'm just kicking at the ocean with these stupid little ape feet and all I know is it's dark in one direction and a little less dark in the other and my chest is so tight it feels like it's going to burst, like somehow I've got a whole roomful of air jammed in there ready to explode. And it almost does, I almost suffer a fucking embolism before I remember that that last gulp of air I took, it was under pressure: the closer I get to the surface the more it expands, the harder it pushes to get out. So I open my mouth. I open my mouth and I vomit all that precious air into the sea and I follow the bubbles as fast as I can, I pray to God the air doesn't bleed out of me faster than it swells up inside. I'm kicking and clawing at the water and suddenly the light overhead has texture somehow, that dull greenish glow resolves into distinct shafts of light and they're dancing, I swear to God they're dancing. Suddenly there's a roof over my head, like a writhing mirror, like mercury, and I break through and I feel like I could swallow the whole fucking sky and I'm so glad to be alive, man, you have no idea. I couldn't care less about Behrendt or Chino or even poor old conspiracy-crackpot Leavenworth. I'm so glad to be alive I don't even notice the hellscape I've dragged myself into--,Oh, that.,Yeah, I am a bit more eloquent than I used to be. Sometimes. Writhing mirrors and dancing lights. Never used to talk like that before. Now I just, you know. Switch back and forth. Don't even notice it half the time.,--This text refers to an alternate , edition.",

Happily, Margo Gottlieb is the exception. In this exciting, practitioner-friendly volume, she shows us how assessment as, for, and of learning can provide a level playing field for today’s language learners. Educators working with English language learners will find this assessment-moxie book truly invaluable."" , -- W.

Program Director Published On: 2015-09-28,"",Assessing Language Learners: Bridges to Educational Equity / Connecting Academic Language Proficiency to Student Achievement, 2e, is a great resource for teacher education programs and professional learning opportunities for schools. The book presents a new vision about assessment in the 21st century, which is influenced by new standards, accountability and technological advances in education. The new concept of Assessment as, for, and of Learning that Gottlieb presents will transform education and provide a different perspective of assessment to all stakeholders. This is definitely a book that all educators should read."" , -- Miguel Fernandez, Ph.D., Associate Professor Published On: 2015-07-22, -- Jonathan Gibson, Title III English Learner Program Director Published On: 2016-01-11,"",Framed by a lens of equity, Gottlieb makes the complex landscape of assessment accessible for classroom practitioners of English language learners. Readers will walk away with a crystal clear understanding of the instructional conditions they can create for English language learners, promoting linguistically responsive assessment practices."", -- Trish Morita-Mullaney, Ph.D., ELL Assistant Professor Published On: 2016-01-15,""While we know that first-hand teaching experiences cannot readily be substituted by reading about the work and practice of others, with evocative scenarios of teachers, students and schools used throughout ,Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges to Educational Equity,, Margo Gottlieb comes close to making this happen. This is critical in two ways: first, the book is lively and interesting--serving as a welcome, well-designed text for teacher preparation courses, and second, the scenarios with their companion reflection questions can serve as an excellent stand-alone reference and thought-provoking resource for the increasing number of classroom teachers who find themselves responsible for the instruction and assessment of students acquiring English alongside their content area learning."", -- Alison L. Bailey, Professor of Human Development and Psychology Published On: 2016-01-18,""Assessing English Language Learners, is an important contribution to the field for the many educators who believe that assessment for second language learners is important, but only if it is valid. This book lays out a clear and compelling argument that assessment and equity are not mutually exclusive concepts in educational programs for the nation′s burgeoning population of multilingual learners. Its breadth is impressive and includes important discussions about language proficiency assessment, but also adds ideas for content area assessment practices. Important reading for practitioners and educational leaders,."" -- Kathy Escamilla, Professor Published On: 2016-02-02, -- Valerie Shinas, Associate Professor Published On: 2017-02-22",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png

,  The Membranes: A Novel (Modern Chinese Literature from Taiwan) ,"   June 1, 2021 ", 17.00 ," 9.99 , 60.06 ",75 ,"Named a Reviewer's Choice Best Book of 2021 ― ,Tor.com,A Books of the Year 2021 selection ― ,The White Review,Chosen as a Best Translated Book of 2021 ― ,Words Without Borders,Books are all time-capsules, of course, but Chi’s novel offers an exquisite dual experience―because while ,The Membranes, is a modern classic, it hasn’t lost an ounce of its provocative significance. As a gently incisive puzzle-box it works to pry at the readers’ own emotions about the nature of stories and how we’re made of them; as a novel of queer attachment, it explores how we attempt to connect to one another through endless membranes―and often fail to do so. ― ,Tor.com,There’s something very timely about [,The Membranes,'] play with gender fluidity and the social construction of identity. There’s also something timeless about Chi’s future, because of how it bends and defies time itself. The novel is about how identity is a story we tell ourselves through time ― or back through time. And that story, for Chi, is queer . . . English readers who finish it now, 25 years after it was first published, may regret finding it so late, and missing out on all the stories and selves we could have been, even as it seems like it’s been here the whole time. ― ,Los Angeles Times,This rather astonishing science fiction novel is a powerful story about consciousness and connection with other people. It cuts right to the heart of our current moment by way of metaphor, but in a manner that is entirely Chi’s, and thus a new thing for English-language readers. What a surprising and exciting addition to science fiction and world literature. -- Kim Stanley Robinson, author of ,Red Mars,What a breath of retro-fresh air! This wicked-smart cyberpunk throwback from the early days of networked digital culture presciently foregrounds issues of gender, embodiment, identity, and technology that have become all the more relevant over the quarter-century since its original publication. -- Susan Stryker, executive editor of ,TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly,Readers will notice prescient echoes of modern life in Chi’s depictions of all-absorbing media consumption and loneliness in the midst of hyper-connection . . . [T]his captivating novel is rich and rewarding. ― ,Publishers Weekly,A fascinating new book. ― ,MIT Technology Review,A mind-blowing book . . . I have NEVER read anything like it. ― ,Literary Infatuation,The Membranes, speaks as much to hard-core sci-fi fans seeking an exhilarating read as to regular readers who desire a moment of introspection. -- Stella Jiayue Zhu ― ,Leeds Centre for New Chinese Writing Book Review Network,The Membranes, is a welcome addition to the small but growing ranks of international science fiction available in English translation, and is an excellent early example of climate fiction. ― ,Booklist,A plunging submersible disguised as a novel―filled with incisive, inventive peculiarities. ― ,Du Mois Archival Institute, 2021 Reading List Selection,It is almost unfathomable that, in 1995, Chi could have imagined a world so full of the terrors that technological rises inevitably bring, but he does and mostly to devastating effect. Chi’s project is large, as is his vision . . . it imagines the future like the best of our dystopian meditations. ― ,South China Morning Post Magazine,Mind-blowing . . . This 1995 Taiwanese sci-fi with casual queer characters is a short read, but it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Way after finishing the story, the questions it posed still linger, surely to haunt me for a long time to come. ― ,Hsinju’s Lit Log,Chi is an excellent novelist and Momo’s story, with the unanswered questions, her mental state and the climate change issues and consequences, all help make this a first-class novel. ― ,The Modern Novel,One of the most profound LGBTQ books of our time. ― ,Books & Bao,An exploration of the contact zones between human and non-human consciousness, corporality, and identity. Reading it feels like peeling off the skin of a fruit, except that when it seems you are getting to the juicy flesh, it turns out to be only another veil―a membrane―and you’ve got to keep going. ― ,Cha: An Asian Literary Journal,Effectively a modern fable, ,The Membranes, creates a punk, dystopian novella set in the near future. It is ideal for anyone who wishes to immerse themselves in a queer future which interrogates the very nature of authentic humanism. ― ,Saoirse Edits,The Membranes ,is a fascinating and beautifully conceived novel, deceptively simple and alluringly deep, smoothly mediated by the membrane of Heinrich’s excellent translation. -- Astrid Møller-Olsen ― ,Xiaoshuo Blog,[,The Membranes,] lives up to its reputation as a classic of the genre . . . Compact enough to be read in an afternoon, the novella contains a plot so expansive that it will preoccupy the mind far longer. ― ,Asian Review of Books,A slim, intelligent novella that ambitiously projects a militarised and corporate new world order in the rubble of environmental collapse, Chi’s brand of world-building is equally invested in envisioning new global formations as it is in attesting to emerging sexual subjectivities. It bristles with the emancipatory energy that characterises the novels coming out of post-martial-law Taiwan . . . Beneath its troubling view of a world plunged into crisis, there is still a hint of humanism in the novel’s belief that if selfhood is not an eternal truth but a queer fiction, then we must keep reading, writing, translating, pirating, photocopying, citing, and sharing ourselves into existence. ― ,Asymptote,Whether as time capsule or prophecy, this novel holds up. -- Adam Wescott ― ,Politics & Prose Staff Picks,Originally published in Chinese in 1995, this sci-fi novel is still able to sweep you off your feet . . . Boundaries are softened in this narrative in more than one sense and even 25 years after its debut in Taiwan, this classic of queer speculative fiction still gives us plenty of food for thought. ― ,24stories,The Membranes, is an exceptionally well-conceived and turned science fiction story. Deceptively simple-looking on the surface, it is a truly impressive piece of work. ― ,Complete Review,[This book] is so deliciously weird . . . The plot twist at the end is one of the best I’ve read. ― ,Biblio Obscura,The Membranes, rewards repeated reading, growing increasingly poignant as it builds toward its startling – and haunting – conclusion. ― ,ABC News (Australia),It’s the astonishing intimacy of Chi’s Wachowski-worthy plot twist (and for those who go on to read the book, note that, The Membranes ,predates any Keanu Reeves-helmed cyberpunk by at least three years) that has me still mulling over this book. It’s not a twist that relies on shock and bombast. Chi’s ,modus, here relies on gentleness, on familial love against all odds. Ari Larissa Heinrich does an excellent job translating these complicated plot elements into English, obscuring the truth while making us think we have everything plainly. -- Spencer Ruchti ― ,Du Mois Monthly Newsletter,[I]t’s only when you see later on how all these ideas, old and new, gender-concerned and not, merge together, that the sheer power of this piece comes to the fore. The rug-pulling has been so subtle no seismometer would ever have sensed it, but by the end we’re upended by it all in quite dramatic fashion. ― ,NB Magazine,In Ari Larissa Heinrich’s adept translation, the prose of this Taiwanese 1995 novella arrives direct and declarative, like the semi-confessional writing that internet users committed to sites like LiveJournal around that time. It’s short, propulsive, and deceptively approachable . . . The queer liberation we can read in ,The Membranes, is that we each contain the freedom to define ourselves, using scraps of experience, story, and fantasy in and around us. Recognizing how malleable we are, we can reimagine ourselves as needed. It can be terrifying and vulnerable to let one’s certainties crumble, but in a world that limits or rejects you, it’s the only way to survive. ― ,The World of Chinese,The world of ,The Membranes, is one where consequential new freedoms cohabitate with climate destruction, hyper-corporatization, and militarization, encouraging the reader to dream big while staying vigilant. ― ,Necessary Fiction,A classic that appeared far ahead of the current new wave science fiction in the Sinophone world, ,The Membranes, remains a unique alterity in terms of genre-crossing and gender reflexivity. Chi’s beautiful, mesmerizing, provocative narrative creates a splendid labyrinth of metaphors and significances that leads to a revelation about the (post)human changeability in a matrix of monotonous inhumanity. -- Mingwei Song, coeditor of ,The Reincarnated Giant: An Anthology of Twenty-First-Century Chinese Science Fiction,An extraordinary novella . . . at last available in English in a brilliant translation by Ari Larissa Heinrich. At just 134 pages, its scope is dazzling. Now, from the vantage point of the future, its playful and unsettling insights into digital saturation, the traps of consciousness and labor, and the fugitive fabulations of identity and the self, have only grown more profound. -- Chris Littlewood ― ,The Paris Review Daily,The Membranes, presents a future where possibility is not defined only by technologies and economics, where gender is fluid, families are chosen, and the narratives we construct for ourselves are part of what makes us human. -- Ruth Joffre ― ,The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide,Trust me on this ― if you have even the tiniest interest in storytelling, you want to read ,The Membranes., -- Deepanjana Pal ― ,Dear Reader,A pitch-perfect meditation on medical advances, transplantation, advanced technology, loneliness, memory, and love. -- Rachel Cordasco ― ,Strange Horizons,Chi’s rendering of certain surveillance and communications technologies is strikingly accurate. The novel offers a fin de siècle vision of a bleak future, while distilling kaleidoscopic influences into the textured intimacy of a mother-daughter tale that alternately reads as a quest for one’s origins. -- Mike Fu ― ,Public Books,The Membranes, (膜) is more than original. It’s extraordinary. -- Bradley Winterton ― ,Taipei Times,The Membranes, is not the novel that will teach readers how to deal with climate change. But it does, in its intimate way, show readers how we might live with it . . . [The book] is a climate novel not because it contends with catastrophe, but because it shows that everydayness has a way of proceeding alongside disaster. -- Ariel Chu ― ,The Rumpus,An amazing, wild experience . . . It completely made me rethink the human experience and my grasp on reality. -- Chloe Gong ― ,Viva Magazine NZ,It offers an original, entertaining, and fast-paced vision, translated from Chinese with perfect pitch, and can be pleasantly devoured in a single sitting. -- Josh Stenberg ― ,Australian Book Review,The Membranes ,is a treasure in that it offers readers something new in each subsequent reading, and it is certain to increase in relevance as we move into our own future. -- Eleanor Keisman ― ,Litro Magazine,The reading experience is like peeling back thin layers of truth, as each chapter reveals the darker and twisted realities that Momo inhabits. Like nesting dolls, or a dream inside a dream, each layer takes hold onto a sublimated anxiety of our collective consciousness. This book is a diamond, it’s a double edged sword, and it’s a bubble ripe to pop. -- Iris Tobin of A Room of One’s Own Bookstore ― ,Literary Hub,An excellent, moving novel. -- Scott Manley Hadley ― ,Triumph of the Now,Chi Ta-wei is a renowned writer and scholar from Taiwan. Chi’s scholarly work focuses on LGBT studies, disability studies, and Sinophone literary history, while his award-winning creative writing ranges from science fiction to queer short stories.
