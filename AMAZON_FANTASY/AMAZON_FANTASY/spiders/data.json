Tolkien was an early work, very distinctive in its mode, completed in 1926: he returned to it later to make hasty corrections, but seems never to have considered its publication. This edition is twofold, for there exists an illuminating commentary on the text of the poem by the translator himself, in the written form of a series of lectures given at Oxford in the 1930s; and from these lectures a substantial selection has been made, to form also a commentary on the translation in this book. From his creative attention to detail in these lectures there arises a sense of the immediacy and clarity of his vision. It is as if he entered into the imagined past: standing beside Beowulf and his men shaking out their mail-shirts as they beached their ship on the coast of Denmark, listening to the rising anger of Beowulf at the taunting of Unferth, or looking up in amazement at Grendel’s terrible hand set under the roof of Heorot. But the commentary in this book includes also much from those lectures in which, while always anchored in the text, he expressed his wider perceptions. He looks closely at the dragon that would slay Beowulf \"snuffling in baffled rage and injured greed when he discovers the theft of the cup\"; but he rebuts the notion that this is \"a mere treasure story\", \"just another dragon tale\". He turns to the lines that tell of the burying of the golden things long ago, and observes that it is \"the feeling for the treasure itself, this sad history\" that raises it to another level. \"The whole thing is sombre, tragic, sinister, curiously real. The ‘treasure’ is not just some lucky wealth that will enable the finder to have a good time, or marry the princess. It is laden with history, leading back into the dark heathen ages beyond the memory of song, but not beyond the reach of imagination.\" ", "Sellic spell", ",", "a \"marvellous tale\", is a story written by Tolkien suggesting what might have been the form and style of an Old English folk-tale of Beowulf, in which there was no association with the \"historical legends\" of the Northern kingdoms.", "The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings,", " and ", "The Silmarillion.", " His books have been translated into more than fifty languages and have sold many millions of copies worldwide.", "The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales,", " and ", "The History of Middle-earth."]},

Además de estas cosas, Melquíades dejó muestras de los siete metales correspondientes a los siete planetas, las fórmulas de Moisés y Zósimo para el doblado del oro, y una serie de apuntes y dibujos sobre los procesos del ", "Gran Magisterio", ", que permitían a quien supiera interpretarlos intentar la fabricación de la piedra filosofal. Seducido por la simplicidad de las fórmulas para doblar el oro, José Arcadio Buendía cortejó a Úrsula durante varias semanas, para que le permitiera desenterrar sus monedas coloniales y aumentarlas tantas veces como era posible subdividir el azogue. Úrsula cedió, como ocurría siempre, ante la inquebrantable obstinación de su marido. Entonces José Arcadio Buendía echó treinta doblones en una cazuela, y los fundió con raspadura de cobre, oropimente, azufre y plomo. Puso a hervir todo a fuego vivo en un caldero de aceite de ricino hasta obtener un jarabe espeso y pestilente más parecido al caramelo vulgar que al oro magnífico. En azarosos y desesperados procesos de destilación, fundida con los siete metales planetarios, trabajada con el mercurio hermético y el vitriolo de Chipre, y vuelta a cocer en manteca de cerdo a falta de aceite de rábano, la preciosa herencia de Úrsula quedó reducida a un chicharrón carbonizado que no pudo ser desprendido del fondo del caldero. Cuando volvieron los gitanos, Úrsula había predispuesto contra ellos a toda la población. Pero la curiosidad pudo más que el temor, porque aquella vez los gitanos recorrieron la aldea haciendo un ruido ensordecedor con toda clase de instrumentos músicos, mientras el pregonero anunciaba la exhibición del más fabuloso hallazgo de los nasciancenos. De modo que todo el mundo se fue a la carpa, y mediante el pago de un centavo vieron un Melquíades juvenil, repuesto, desarrugado, con una dentadura nueva y radiante. Quienes recordaban sus encías destruidas por el escorbuto, sus mejillas fláccidas y sus labios marchitos se estremecieron de pavor ante aquella prueba terminante de los poderes sobrenaturales del gitano. El pavor se convirtió en pánico cuando  Melquíades se sacó los dientes, intactos, engastados en las encías, y se los mostró al público por un instante —un instante fugaz en que volvió a ser el mismo hombre decrépito de los años anteriores— y se los puso otra vez y sonrió de nuevo con un dominio pleno de su juventud restaurada. Hasta el propio José Arcadio Buendía consideró que los conocimientos de Melquíades habían llegado a extremos intolerables, pero experimentó un saludable alborozo cuando el gitano le explicó a solas el mecanismo de su dentadura postiza. Aquello le pareció a la vez tan sencillo y prodigioso, que de la noche a la mañana perdió todo interés en las investigaciones de alquimia; sufrió una nueva crisis de mal humor, no volvió a comer en forma regular y se pasaba el día dando vueltas por la casa. «En el mundo están ocurriendo cosas increíbles», le decía a Úrsula. «Ahí mismo, al otro lado del río, hay toda clase de aparatos mágicos, mientras nosotros seguimos viviendo como los burros.»  "]},
